      </div>

      <p>
        Sleep is so important for a variety of reasons. It affects our health,
        mood, focus and recovery from exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lack of sleep can also make food cravings more intense! When you sleep
        well, you simply don't need to exert as much willpower to moderate your
        intake. It's a commonly underestimated factor when it comes to fat loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, the goal of this article is not to focus on why sleep is
        important. I'm going to assume you already understand this and are
        interested in some practical advice for how to improve the quality and
        consistency of your sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also going to assume that you've heard about the drawbacks of having
        caffeine too late in the day or staring at digital screens too close to
        bedtime so many times that it doesn't need to be repeated here. I want
        to focus more on the kind of tips we don't hear as often, the underrated
        and overlooked nuggets of sleep wisdom that took me a while to figure
        out and that many of my clients had never seriously considered before.
      </p>

      <h2>Keep the room <span class="magentaText">dark</span></h2>

      <p>
        Installing black-out blinds on your bedroom windows can be an absolute
        game-changer if sunlight is disturbing your sleep before you're ready to
        wake up. An eye mask can be a great alternative if it's not practical to
        block your windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though not as significant a factor, also pay close attention to how many
        seemingly innocuous lights are in your bedroom. Consider dimming the
        display on your clocks and any other electronic devices that allow you
        to adjust the ambient light they give off.
      </p>

      <p>
        While sunlight does help your body to maintain its circadian cycle,
        unless the best time for you to wake up is the same as the time the
        morning sun is first hitting your bedroom windows, keeping your room
        dark until you awake and <em>then</em> opening your curtains or going
        out into a sunlit room is a great way to make sure your sleep cycle is
        synced with your preferred wake time.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need to get up at 9 AM, but your room starts getting bright at 7
        AM, those last couple hours of sleep are probably taking a major hit;
        you might not be getting as many hours of quality sleep as you think.
      </p>

      <h2>Keep the room <span class="magentaText">cool & fresh</span></h2>

      <p>
        We all know how difficult it is to sleep when you're hot and sweaty, but
        even being "comfortably warm" might be getting in the way of
        higher-quality sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Experiment with setting your air conditioner a bit lower than normal and
        you might be surprised at how much better you sleep. If your room
        doesn't have an air conditioner (as was the case when I lived in
        Seattle) it might be worth it to invest in a standing unit. It made a
        huge difference for my wife and me.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this seems to be a bigger factor for some than others, I sleep
        <em>much better</em> when the room is chilly and I have just enough
        coverage in sheets and blankets to not get too cold. One reason for this
        seems to be that my sinuses are quite finicky! They open up noticeably
        and I breathe a lot easier when the air is cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of breathing easy: maintaining fresh air flow in your room is
        an extremely underrated sleeping tip. Sometimes all you need to do is
        crack a window at night or keep your bedroom door open so your room
        doesn't get stuffy. You might also consider installing an oscillating
        fan or an air filter.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don't need to have full-blown sleep apnea to benefit from these
        small changes in air quality that make it slightly easier to breathe at
        night.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="magentaText">Stretch</span> a bit before bedtime</h2>

      <p>
        Every night before I get into bed, I take off my t-shirt and use it to
        stretch my chest and shoulders by bringing my arms overhead and behind
        my back while keeping my arms straight.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've had this habit for a few years now. It takes less than a minute
        each night, but the daily consistency has helped me keep my shoulders
        flexible and that helps me to sleep on my side (my preferred position)
        without my shoulders feeling achy or stiff.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I don't stretch my hips every night, I've also found that doing a
        few simple stretches for my hip flexors and glutes before bed also helps
        me to sleep more comfortably, especially if they're a little sore from a
        recent workout.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you often feel restless and shift around a lot to get comfortable, a
        few minutes of stretching close to bedtime may help you sleep without
        having to wake up and adjust your position so often.
      </p>

      <h2>Do more steady <span class="magentaText">cardio</span></h2>

      <p>
        I admit this is a more serious investment of time and energy compared to
        other simple tips like wearing an eye mask or opening a window, but it's
        also the most potent advice I can give you for improving your sleep
        quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        We all know it's much easier to sleep when we're both calm and tired.
        For example, my high-energy dog fell asleep sitting upright in the back
        of our car on the way home from her first camping trip. She was already
        exhausted, and as soon as she felt safe and relaxed in a familiar
        setting she was OUT LIKE A LIGHT.
      </p>

      <img
        src="./blog-pix/sleepy-sam2.jpg"
        alt="Floofy white dog asleep in the back of a car while facing to the side sitting upright"
      />
      <span class="picCaption">DOG TIRED</span>

      <p>
        Even if it's bright outside and you're not in a particularly comfortable
        setting, when you're tired and relaxed enough you're going to fall fast
        asleep anyway. Long, steady cardio sessions aren't just great for
        general health and mood, they also help you get into that state where
        you can easily fall into a deep, rejuvenating sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can be a long walk, run, hike, bike ride, etc. Any form of exercise
        that requires steady focus and exertion for 30+ minutes will do. I've
        emphasized the word <em>steady</em> because while intervals are
        certainly fatiguing, they tend to amp you up and release adrenaline
        which can make it harder to go to sleep if you do them too close to
        bedtime. The same goes for lifting weights: whenever possible, leave
        yourself a few hours between your lifting sessions and bedtime so you
        can wind down.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most obvious reasons we stay up too late is we're simply not
        tired yet. Yes, ingesting caffeine late in the day or staring at
        electronic screens late in the evening can contribute to feeling awake
        when it's time to sleep, but I think there's too much focus on avoiding
        the things that make us feel awake and not enough on doing the things
        that make us feel tired.
      </p>

      <p>
        A long evening walk after dinner can benefit you in a lot of different
        ways, not least of which is the positive effect it has on sleep. It
        doesn't just make you tired either; all that movement can do wonders for
        helping you to physically relax and feel less restless in bed, more even
        than stretching.
      </p>

      <h2>Tire yourself out <span class="magentaText">mentally</span></h2>

      <p>
        Building off the previous point about doing things that make you tired,
        cardio may be the best example overall due to its effect on both the
        body and the mind, but other great options help you sleep by fatiguing
        you mentally, such as reading or playing video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone is going to have their own unique set of mentally fatiguing
        activities that work well in this regard. For example, my wife merely
        adopted gaming, whereas I was born in it, molded by it. One or two hours
        of a challenging game has a significant effect on how tired she feels,
        whereas I can play for hours before accumulating any notable mental
        fatigue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading before you go to sleep works great for a lot of people, but
        <em>what</em> you read can make a big difference. An exciting
        science-fiction novel might keep you up all night, excited to find out
        what happens next, whereas a comparatively dry non-fiction book may have
        you nodding off rather quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps journaling, solving puzzles or writing software code is your
        ticket to Snoozeville. You may have to do a little experimenting to find
        out what kind of activities quickly fatigue you, but once you do,
        consider making them a regular part of your evening routine.
      </p>

      <h2>Go to bed <span class="magentaText">sober</span></h2>

      <p>
        I know this is easier said than done, <strong>believe me</strong>. I
        have a rich history of alcohol and cannabis use myself, and there have
        been stretches where I consistently used one or both for so long that I
        completely forgot how much better I slept without them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also understand that it <em>feels like</em> you sleep better with
        these recreational aides, but that's an illusion; they may help you get
        to sleep, but the way they disrupt or completely rob you of important
        sleep states such as deep R.E.M. means your quality of sleep suffers,
        i.e. it may take you 8-9 hours of intoxicated sleep to feel as rested as
        6 hours of sober sleep, and you'll still feel more groggy in the
        morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not saying you need to go "straight edge", but if you've been using
        drugs to relax most nights a week for quite a while, consider taking a
        break for a month and pay especially close attention to how it affects
        your sleep. At first, you will probably struggle with insomnia due to
        withdrawal and your brain needing to readjust, but after that, you
        should not only notice that you feel <em>significantly</em> more rested
        in less time, but you'll also wake up more easily and feel more focused
        throughout the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a great point at which to reiterate the wonders of cardio: a lot
        of folks have found that exercise is a fantastic way to achieve those
        feelings of euphoria and relaxation that we get from alcohol or
        cannabis. The phrase "runner's high" is more accurate than a lot of
        people realize; the exercise-induced euphoria it refers to largely stems
        from our endocannabinoid system, the same system that THC stimulates.
        You can literally get <em>high as fuck</em> from exercise, especially a
        long hard cardio session, without all the downsides that come with using
        exogenous substances.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may find that, as you incorporate more exercise into your lifestyle,
        it becomes easier to limit your intake of mind-altering substances,
        perhaps to the point where you can quit entirely. Even if exercise
        doesn't affect those things, it will still have all kinds of wonderful
        effects on your health, mood, energy levels and of course sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        While you don't need to implement every one of these tips to experience
        tangible improvements to your sleep, I do encourage you to try and stack
        several of them together every once in a while. You'll never have a
        better night's sleep than after a long day packed with lifting, cardio,
        stretching, gaming and reading before you climb into bed completely
        sober in a cool, dark room full of fresh air.
