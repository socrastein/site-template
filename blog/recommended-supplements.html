      <p>
        I find that a lot of people tend to land far on one side or the other of
        the "Opinions on Supplements" spectrum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either they have bought into marketing hype so much that they regularly
        spend hundreds of dollars on products that are dubious at best
        (expensive scams at worst) OR they write off the entire industry as
        completely worthless and never use any kind of supplement at all,
        assuming that even the most well-supported products are probably a total
        waste because the whole field just seems <i>sus</i>.
      </p>

        alt="Meme of fry from Futurama squinting suspiciously with the caption 'Not sure if legit supplement or expensive nonsense'"
      />
      <span class="picCaption"> I can understand the skepticism </span>

      <p>
        Like so many topics in the health and fitness industry, there is some
        truth behind both sides but it's not obvious how to separate the wheat
        from the chaff, i.e. the legitimate products from the nonsense. That's
        precisely what I intend to do with this article; I am going to give you
        an overview of the handful of supplements I have been personally using
        and professionally recommending to clients for many years, including how
        they can help and some tips to make sure you're getting a quality
        version.

      <h2>On the value of supplements</h2>

      <p>
        Before I cover any specific supplements, there's an extremely important
        point I need to emphasize: supplements are SUPPLEMENTAL to a proper
        exercise routine and diet. More often than not, the benefits and
        progress you think the right supplements will give you are actually
        going to come from an intelligent lifting program combined with
        consistently high-quality nutrition and
        <a href="./sleeping-tips.html" target="_blank">good sleep habits</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've spoken with so many fitness enthusiasts who drop a sizeable amount
        of money on supplements every month, yet their lifting routine is a joke
        or they don't even lift at all. These folks haven't cooked a decent meal
        in months and can't remember the last time they got 8 hours of quality
        sleep, yet they're taking a bunch of supplements thinking that will
        somehow makeup for the fact that they're neglecting the basic pillars of
        health.
      </p>

      <div class="leftBorderList">
        <h3>
          Supplements are SUPPLEMENTAL to a proper exercise routine and diet
        </h3>
      </div>

      <p>
        Taking a bunch of supplements while completely neglecting a solid
        workout routine is like making sure you always have mints on hand yet
        you never brush or floss your teeth. That might be hard for some of you
        to hear, but I can't write an entire article about what is ultimately a
        small slice of the health & fitness pie without making sure I'm not
        giving people the wrong impression about the relative importance of
        these <i>supplemental</i> products. I want you to prioritize
        intelligently and focus your efforts where they matter most instead of
        "majoring in the minors".
      </p>

      <p>
        To be clear, I don't mean to say that you can't get benefits from
        something like Vitamin D unless you're lifting and eating a high-protein
        diet. Some supplements will give you a benefit regardless of what your
        movement or eating habits look like, but you shouldn't think for one
        second that supplements are anything but a miniscule contributor to your
        overall health and fitness. Even a solid, evidence-based supplement
        routine followed consistently is going to represent a tiny percentage of
        your overall health and progress compared to sound exercise, diet and
        recovery strategies.
      </p>

      <p>
        To put it another way: you can be extremely healthy and fit even if you
        never took a single one of the supplements I highlight in this article,
        so long as you're regularly engaging in resistance training, eating a
        variety of nutritious foods and managing stress and recovery
        appropriately, but the reverse isn't true in the slightest.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you never lift, you eat a nutritionally deficient diet and ignore the
        importance of sleep and stress management, then your health and fitness
        will suffer greatly, even if you diligently take every supplement
        mentioned in this article for the rest of your life. I mean, creatine is
        amazing and I'll expand on why below, but if you never lift then
        sarcopenia and frailty are going to destroy your quality of life decades
        before they would otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you really need to buy a $40 tub of pre-workout if you're just going
        to sit on your phone for 8 minutes between your lame-ass sets of sloppy
        isolation work? You'd get much better results if you just had a cup of
        coffee and then did some legitimate sets of squatting and pressing. Get
        the basics dialed in FIRST, then consider incorporating a few
        supplements to enhance what should already be a solid overall routine.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am going to focus on the supplements that have the best cost/benefit
        ratios, the best "bang for your buck".
