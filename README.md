# The Lifting School Website

This is an ongoing project that allows me to implement the various skills I am learning in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The plan is to fully replace my professional website that is currently hosted through Wix, not only saving me money in hosting fees
but also serving as a portfolio project to showcase a variety of features and designs I am capable of producing. 

At first, I intend to host a static site through GitHub with form functionality for my sign up form provided by [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). 
After that, I would like to implement a dynamic website with a backend database, first through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and then eventually
through a rented server that hosts backend code I have written myself.
