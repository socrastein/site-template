          <p>Matt has been training in private and semi-private settings <em>for over 15 years</em>.</p>
        
          <p>In that time, he's taught several hundred people how to lift and run without joint pain, how to lose weight through sustainable nutrition habits, and how to build size and strength with consistent, focused efforts. He also enjoys teaching the fundamentals of boxing to anyone who is interested</p>

          <p>You may be surprised to learn that, before he ever got into lifting, Matt was a big nerd who loved reading science and philosophy books, building computers, solving Rubik's Cubes and playing video games. He's not someone who has been athletic and fit his whole life; he didn't even start getting into fitness until he was nearly 20 years old, but once he got into it he got <strong>really</strong> into it.</p>

            <h3>He's not someone who has been athletic and fit his whole life</h3>
          </div>
        
          <p>His clients know him as a stickler for form with great attention to detail, always ready to explain why they're doing something a particular way and how it will help.</p>
          <p>Matt doesn't just have years of professional experience: he <em>personally understands</em> what it's like to struggle to change your body and having to build your fitness slowly. Weighing over 300 lbs in high school, he spent the next couple years losing over 100 lbs and overcoming debilitating joint pain. In spite of his youth, he dealt with multiple knee dislocations, chronic headaches and crippling back pain, on top of the insecurity and social anxiety that usually accompanies growing up overweight.</p>

            <h3>Weighing over 300 lbs in high school, he spent the next couple years losing over 100 lbs</h3>
          </div>
        
          <p>One day he decided he wanted to do something about his weight and seriously study how to exercise. This quickly developed into a life-long passion for understanding the human body and how it adapts to physical challenges. He was able to steadily fix all of his joint pains and limitations through carefully planned exercise, building significant levels of strength and athleticism he once thought impossible.</p>
        
          <p>Initially having no plans to train anyone but himself, he was so shocked by how much lifting weights changed the way his body looked, moved and felt that he was inspired to teach others how to lift properly. He got his first job as a personal trainer at the YMCA in his hometown.</p>

          <p>Being a voracious reader with an intense attention span, Matt spent thousands of hours over the next decade studying exercise science and nutrition. He didn't just want to be competent as a trainer, he wanted to be <em>exceptional</em> and learn from the best in the field. He has read hundreds of articles and several books by some of the best coaches and teachers in the industry. He's taught private sessions and group classes at several gyms in Washington and Idaho, worked as a rock-climbing instructor and self-defense coach, and has even given paid presentations on strength training to his professional peers.</p>

          </div>

          <p>It doesn't make much sense to sell coaching services if you've never worked with a coach yourself. Matt is both a student and a teacher at heart, having learned from over a dozen different lifting and fighting coaches over the years: powerlifting, strongman, bodybuilding, Western boxing, Thai boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, rock climbing and parkour. Knowing first-hand what a difference expert instruction makes when learning new skills, he enjoys providing guidance and instilling confidence in other people .</p>

            <h3>Matt is both a student and a teacher at heart</h3>
          </div>

          <p>Matt loves teaching people new skills and watching them grow over time.</p>

          <p>He has deadlifted over 500 lbs without a lifting belt, squatted over 400 lbs ass-to-grass and bench-pressed over 300 lbs, all without any joint pain. Because he always wants to speak from experience, Matt doesn't teach any style of lifting he hasn't extensively practiced in his own training.</p>

          <p>Matt started his first training business in Seattle, working with personal clients and small groups for a few years before moving back to his native state of Idaho. He started The Lifting School LLC in 2020 and has primarily worked with people as an online coach since then.</p>

          <p>He also loves to hike, camp, go on long bike rides and enter 5K runs with his wife, best friend and lifting partner of over 15 years, Summer. When Matt & Summer aren't working out together, they enjoy reading, cooking extravagent meals, playing video games, watching great television and walking their dog Sammie.</p>
