      <p>Matt has been training in private and semi-private settings <em>for over 15 years</em>.</p>
        
      <p>He's taught several hundred people how to lift and run without joint pain, how to lose weight through sustainable nutrition habits, and how to build size and strength with consistent, focused efforts. His clients know him as a stickler for great form who is always ready to expand in detail on why they're doing something a particular way and how it can help.</p>

      <div class="leftBorderList">
        <h3>His clients know him as a stickler for great form</h3>
      </div>

      <p>Matt personally understands what it's like to struggle to change the body and have to build your fitness slowly. He has personal experience with overcoming obesity and debilitating joint pain, having weighed over 300 lbs during high school and dealt with multiple knee dislocations, chronic headaches and crippling back pain on top of the insecurity and social anxiety that often accompanies growing up overweight.</p> 
        
      <p>One day when he was 18, he decided to do something about his weight and seriously study how to exercise. He lost over 100 lbs in the following two years while developing a deep passion for understanding exercise and transforming the body. He overcame all his joint pains and limitations and built significant levels of strength and athleticism.</p>

      <p>Being a voracious reader with an intense attention span, Matt spent thousands of hours over the next decade studying exercise science and nutrition. He has read hundreds of articles and several books by some of the best coaches and teachers in the industry. He's taught private sessions and group classes at several gyms in Washington and Idaho, worked as a rock-climbing instructor and self-defense coach, and even gave paid presentations to fellow coaches on the fundamentals of strength training.</p> 

      <p>It doesn't make much sense to sell coaching services if you've worked with a coach yourself, but Matt is a both a student and teacher at heart, having learned from over a dozen different lifting and fighting coaches over the years: powerlifting, strongman, bodybuilding, Western boxing, Thai boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, rock climbing and parkour. He knows first-hand what it's like to have expert instruction when learning new skills and wants to provide that type of inpsiration and guidance to others.</p>

      <div class="leftBorderList">
        <h3>Matt is a both a student and a teacher at heart</h3>
      </div>

      <p>That's why he loves teaching people new skills and watching them grow over time.</p>

      <p>He started his first training business in Seattle, working with personal clients and small groups for a few years before moving back to his native Idaho and later starting The Lifting School LLC in 2020.</p>

      <p>Matt has deadlifted over 500 lbs without a lifting belt, squatted over 400 lbs ass-to-grass and bench-pressed over 300 lbs. Because he always wants to speak from experience and be able to relate to what a client is going through, he never teaches any style of lifting he hasn't extensively utilized.</p>

      <p>He also loves to take long hikes, bike rides and enter 5K runs with his wife, best friend and lifting partner of over 15 years, Summer. When Matt & Summer aren't working out together, they enjoy reading, cooking extravagent meals, playing video games, watching great television and walking their dog.
